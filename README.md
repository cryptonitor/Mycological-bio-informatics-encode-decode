# Mycological-bio-informatics-encode-decode
Reading from and writing to- biologic matter- information beyond and through sporeform. Print knowledge from encoded data that grows into information

This one is going to take many lifetimes. Imprinting a form that blooms into knowledge that can be read, in as minimal stuff as possible.
Promisingr results from research on yeast and mycelium. Seems mycelium has an unparalleled ability to compress information into data into some deeper structures in their sporeform that allow them to retain much more of their fruitingform than would seem possible.
There are much aspects on biology not yet fathomed.

Experiments: 

Yeast: Battle of the yeasts... Two types of yeasts left in a vat to duke it out then killing both of them. Trying to assertain the timelines and strains in the resulting goo... Then revive. Then?

Encoding bacteria that are invulnerable to that which kills the yeast, observing abilities to regain abilities beyond death/sporeform.

Decoding sporeform X after cycles of training across tiksnnam. LAMMPS -> Monte Carlo

Goal: Put unformation in an immortal form. If data gets destroyed it will regrow. 
Challenges: Information vs data vs knowledge vs wisdom vs readability
