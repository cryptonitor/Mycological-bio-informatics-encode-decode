DIversity of metabolites as means of programming informatino into the fabric of life, the unverse and everything:
Understanding of the data encoded within as information through the consequence of
-Flavor: 
-Aroma: 
-Color:

Compounds like phenols and esters influence facets of the fabric of life. The essence of what life thrives upon might be the 
most effective way to convey information through time to some unknown life that has no common demominator at all.

Beginnings: Saccharomyces (Cerevisiae). 
Experiments: Aromatic compounds that enhance the sensory profile of resulting growth which has effects to stimulate/nourish.
Goals: Encode information in the ....

Problems: Hard to see what would die off and what might survive through the aeons. 
Aspects of encoding: Multifaceted, able to compress and unfold
Aspects of decoding: Understand information from data imprinted in X

Ways to grasp concept: How can information survive when all else dies? What could survive?
How would it be possible to preserve knowledge across the fire of eternity?
Understanding through enrichment with encoding simplest of biology with the gift to enrich all other life?!
Such that what little surives has the capacity to incite a riot of evolution is the most basic information we need to encode.
